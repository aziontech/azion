The Azion CLI (command-line interface) is an open source tool that enables you to manage any Azion service via command line. Through it, you can manage all Azion products, create automations using CI/CD scripts or pipelines, provision multiple services that make up your application with a few commands, and also manage your Azion configurations as code.

The developer friendly way to interact with Azion!
