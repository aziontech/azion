The Azion CLI (command-line interface) is an open source tool that enables you to manage any Azion service via command line. Through it, you can manage all Azion products, create automations using CI/CD scripts or pipelines, provision multiple services that make up your application with a few commands, and also manage your Azion configurations as code.

The developer friendly way to interact with Azion!

## How to Use

In order to perform network operations it is *mandatory* to provide an authentication token

You can provide token in two ways.
* Using azion-cli configure command (this command saves the token in a configuration file for further use):
$ azioncli configure -t <authentication token>

OR

* Using environment variable (in this way the token will be cleared when the terminal is closed):
$ export AZIONCLI_TOKEN=<authentication token>


You can just run `azioncli` and see it's options
